3995,US4580513A,1,Pattern selecting device for electronic sewing machines a pattern selecting device for a sewing machine of the type having a housing a panel mounted on the housing for indicating a number of pattern indicia to be selected by the sewing machine operator and an electronic memory storing a number of stitch control data for producing the stitches in accordance to the pattern indicia the panel is provided with a first portion carrying a first group of pattern indicia and a second portion for indicating a second group of pattern indicia and a third group of pattern indicia the pattern selecting device includes two screening plates mounted on the second portion both plates are movable relative to the second and third groups of indicia in the second section to selectively hide one of the second and third groups of indicia and visualize the other of the second and third groups of indicia or to hide both the second and third groups of indicia the device is further provided with a switching arrangement operated to move the screening plates relative to the second and third groups of indicia the switching arrangement produces a first electric signal when the screening plates hide one of the second and third groups of indicia and visualize the other of the second and third groups of indicia and produces a second electric signal when the screening plates hide both of the second and third groups of indicia,D0,1983
3996,US9066615B2,1,Feeding assistant robot the present invention relates to a feeding assistant robot which assists in feeding patients or the elderly and infirm who have difficulty in moving their arms and thus have difficulty in feeding themselves the feeding assistant robot includes a picking arm including a gripper for picking up food placed on a tray a feeding arm including a spoon on which the food picked up by the picking arm is placed for moving the spoon to the mouth of a user an input device enabling the user to direct the movements of the picking arm and of the feeding arm and a control unit electrically connected to the picking arm the feeding arm and the manipulation part to control the movements of the picking arm and the feeding arm according to the commands from the input device,A4 B2 A6,2010
3997,US8995619B2,1,Personnel screening system the present specification discloses an inspection system for detecting objects being carried by a person who is moving along a pathway the inspection system has two detection systems configured to detect radiation scattered from the person as the person moves along the pathway and an x ray source positioned between the detection systems the x ray source is configured to generate a vertical beam spot pattern and does not generate beams that move horizontally,G0,2011
3998,US9519805B2,0,Digest obfuscation for data cryptography execution of an obfuscation application may cause a computing device to translate bits of a hashed value according to a sparse bit selection pattern the sparse bit pattern including a translation of bits of the hashed value into reordered bit unit groupings sized according to a numeric base of a digit cypher and generate an obfuscated value using the translated bit unit groupings of the hashed value as indices into the digit cypher the digit cypher including a mapping of the indices to output values in the numeric base the obfuscation application may further cause the device to receive a target value to be obfuscated in data records received from a data source hash the target value using a hashing module to create the hashed value in some cases truncate the hashed value and replace the target value in the data records with the obfuscated value,G0,2013
3999,US10035263B2,1,System and method for inspection and maintenance of hazardous spaces systems and methods for a robotic system capable of carrying out operations in a hazardous or confined space the system comprises a manipulator arm a plinth a trolley an end effector and a control system the plinth and trolley each comprise one or more locking pawls for securing the system to mounting levels along a length of the manipulator arm the system is capable of maneuvering between mounting points in an inch worm like fashion motion starts from a fixed position where both the trolley and plinth locking pawls are secured to a first mounting level along the length of the manipulator arm the trolley locking pawls are then released and the trolley runs along the manipulator and secures locking pawls to a second mounting level along the length of the manipulator arm the plinth locking pawls are then released and the plinth is drawn to the second mounting level along the length of the manipulator arm where it is secured via locking pawls when both the plinth and trolley are secured operations can be carried out,B2,2016
